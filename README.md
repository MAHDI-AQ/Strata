---

## Overview

**Strata AGX** is a downstream C++/CUDA serving fork of [Niko1221/Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata) tailored for **multi-agent swarm concurrency**, **heterogeneous context scaling**, and **low-latency speculative decoding** on Dual NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.

Upstream Strata demonstrated that 125B MoE architectures (like Qwen 3.8 Flash Next) can execute on dual consumer GPUs in single-stream mode ($C=1$). This fork focuses on the multi-agent serving constraints: eliminating FIFO queue head-of-line blocking, enabling zero-copy prefix sharing across parallel agent branches, and serving agent and tool traffic alike through one continuous-batching pool with a fair queue and prefix caching.

### Key Additions Over Upstream

1. **Continuous Multi-Agent Concurrency ($C=1$ to $C=5$):**
   - Replaced coarse round-based batching with token-level continuous micro-scheduling (Orca / vLLM v1 model).
   - Lockless dynamic slot recycling (< 5 µs overhead) upon stream completion.
   - Uniform agent slots at full context: $C$ concurrent streams at up to 262,144 tokens each; additional requests queue and are admitted as slots free (standard continuous-batching admission).
2. **Dynamic RadixTree KV Cache & 3-Tier Storage:**
   - Zero-copy prefix sharing across branching subagent sessions.
   - Sub-millisecond prefix forking for concurrent agent swarms.
   - 3-tier memory hierarchy: L1 VRAM (48GB) $\rightarrow$ L2 Host RAM (96 GB DDR4) $\rightarrow$ L3 NVMe DirectStorage (WD_BLACK SN850X @ 5,500+ MB/s Linux `O_DIRECT`).
3. **Speculative Decoding Engine (SpecTree DAG + Fused GDN):**
   - Multi-Branch SpecTree DAG expansion with 64-bit ancestor masks ($T \le 16$).
   - Fused GDN recurrence and Split-K online softmax attention, raising MTP acceptance yield from ~60% to **75%–90%**.
4. **Cross-GPU Prefill Pipelining (`STRATA_PREFILL_CHAIN=1`):**
   - Chunk-level stage pipelining across dual GPUs, achieving **3,450 tok/s** on IQ3_XXS (single-request path) and **5,355 tok/s** on Q1 Coder.
5. **Bitwise Parity Verification:**
   - Test harness confirming bit-for-bit parity against reference ggml across all 18 quant formats.

### 1. Single-Stream ($C=1$) Baseline — Qwen 3.8 Flash Next IQ3_XXS

Evaluated on `ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF` (IQ3_XXS, 125B MoE with 6B active parameters, 512 experts, 3.06 bpw) using `--max-context 262144` and `--kv q4_0`:

| Metric | Measured Baseline | Program v2 (`v0.1.38-agx.1.0.5`) | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Single-Stream Decode (Short Context)** | 100.5 – 105.2 tok/s | **115.2 – 117.8 tok/s** *(8.49 – 8.68 ms/tok)* | **+9.5% to +14.6%** |
| **Single-Stream Decode (Medium Context, 2.8K)** | 105.2 tok/s | **107.6 tok/s** *(9.30 ms/tok)* | **+2.3%** |
| **Single-Stream Decode (Peak Observed)** | 108.6 tok/s | **129.2 tok/s** *(7.74 ms/tok)* | **+19.0%** |
| **MTP Speculative Acceptance Yield** | ~60.0% – 65.0% | **75.0% – 89.7%** | **+15.0% to +29.7%** |
| **Cold Prefill Throughput** | ~850 tok/s *(Unpipelined)* | **3,450.2 tok/s** *(`STRATA_PREFILL_CHAIN=1`, single-request path `--prefill auto`, 16,384-token chunks)* | **4.1× speedup** |
| **VRAM Expert Residency (262K Context)** | 86.3% (21,209 / 24,576 slots) | 86.3% (21,209 / 24,576 slots) | Preserved |

*Note: Upstream Strata natively supports 262,144 context in single-stream mode; Strata AGX accelerates this single-stream decode path via fused GDN recurrence and Split-K FMHA.*

*Note on the prefill row: the 3,450.2 tok/s figure is the single-request path at `--prefill auto` (16,384-token chunks); the concurrent serving path chunks via `--concurrent-prefill` (≤4096) and measures ≈2.1–2.3K tok/s at depth — raising the concurrent cap is a tracked engine lever.*

### 2. Multi-Agent Concurrency & Throughput Scaling

#### A. Homogeneous Multi-Agent Swarm — Qwen 3.8 Flash Next Coder Q1 (`IQ1_M`, 128K Context)
*100.0% resident experts in VRAM; zero PCIe host stalls:*

| Concurrency ($C$) | Serving Mode | Aggregate Throughput | Per-Agent Decode | Cold Prefill | VRAM Residency |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **$C=1$** | Single Stream | **100.5 – 108.6 tok/s** | 100.5 – 108.6 tok/s | 2,380 tok/s (short) / 5,124 tok/s (bulk) | 100.0% (pinned) |
| **$C=2$** | Dual Agent | **152.40 tok/s** | 100.20 tok/s | — | 100.0% |
| **$C=3$** | Multi-Agent Swarm | **187.50 tok/s** | 82.10 tok/s | — | 100.0% |
| **$C=4$** | Swarm Fan-Out | **205.10 tok/s** | 68.40 tok/s | — | 100.0% |
| **$C=5$** | Full Concurrency (Burst) | **220.04 tok/s** | 59.4 – 68.7 tok/s | 5,355.4 tok/s | 100.0% |
| **$C=5$** | Sustained Sweet Spot (11.5 GHz) | **253.92 tok/s** | 59.2 – 63.2 tok/s | 5,124.2 tok/s | 100.0% |

#### B. Retired Tiered Heterogeneous Swarm — Qwen 3.8 Flash Next `IQ3_XXS` (852K Virtual Context)
*Historical (`v0.1.38-agx.1.0.5`): the tiered auxiliary-slot experiment was removed from the engine on 2026-10-06 as a regression source (it collapsed prefill under load even with no aux traffic). Tool/aux traffic now flows through the standard pool + queue; these figures document the retired build.*
*Evaluated with 3 Primary slots @ 262K context + 1 Aux slot @ 65K context = **851,968 tokens context** (66.6% VRAM residency; 33.4% streamed dynamically from host DDR4 over PCIe 4.0):*

| Stream / Role | Context Allocation | Measured Decode Speed | Step Latency | Turnaround / Wall Time | MTP Acceptance |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Main Orchestrator (Stream 0)** | 262,144 tokens | **58.5 tok/s** | 17.11 ms | 2.34 – 61.5 s | 88.8% |
| **Subagent 1 — Coder (Stream 1)** | 262,144 tokens | **36.6 – 40.3 tok/s** | 24.80 – 27.35 ms | 2.38 – 40.5 s | 87.5% |
| **Subagent 2 — Verifier (Stream 2)** | 262,144 tokens | **42.1 – 50.0 tok/s** | 20.02 – 23.73 ms | 2.45 – 61.4 s | 89.7% |
| **Auxiliary Tool Query (Stream 3)** | 65,536 tokens | **43.4 tok/s** | 23.02 ms | **2.07 s** *(Sub-15ms preemption)* | 91.2% |
| **Total Swarm Capacity** | **851,968 tokens** | **139.9 – 148.8 tok/s** *(Aggregate)* | — | **2.46 s** *(162 toks short fanout)* | **88.8% – 89.7%** |

### 3. Head-to-Head: Vanilla Upstream Strata (v0.1.38) vs Strata AGX (`v0.1.38-agx.1.0.5`)

Evaluated side-by-side on the exact same Dual RTX 4090 rig:

> *Note (2026-10-06): the auxiliary-slot machinery referenced in the rows below was removed from the engine as a regression source; concurrent serving is now a uniform N-slot pool with queue admission. Rows document `v0.1.38-agx.1.0.5`.*

| Capability / Benchmark Metric | Vanilla Upstream Strata (v0.1.38) | Strata AGX (`v0.1.38-agx.1.0.5`) | Empirical Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Multi-Agent Scheduling** | **$C=1$ FIFO Serialization** *(Incoming requests wait for active generation to finish)* | **$C=1$ to $C=5$ Continuous Micro-Scheduling** *(Iteration-level dynamic slot recycling)* | Concurrent multi-agent execution |
| **Auxiliary Request Turnaround** | >15.0 – 22.0 s *(HoL blocking behind active agent output)* | **2.07 s** *(Sub-15ms preemptive queue insertion)* | **86.2% latency reduction** for agent tool calls |
| **Total Concurrent Virtual Context** | 262,144 tokens *(Single slot only)* | **851,968 tokens** *(3× 262K primary + 1× 65K aux)* | **3.25× total concurrent active context** |
| **Prefix Caching & Tree Branching** | Static per-request buffer; cross-GPU parking unsupported | **Dynamic RadixTree** with zero-copy prefix sharing & L2/L3 parking | Zero redundant prefill tokens on agent conversation forks |
| **Aggregate Swarm Throughput ($C=3$)** | 77.48 tok/s *(Serialized FIFO queue)* | **187.50 tok/s** *(Parallel decoding)* | **2.42× throughput scaling** |
| **Aggregate Swarm Throughput ($C=5$)** | 81.73 tok/s *(Serialized FIFO queue)* | **220.04 tok/s (burst) / 253.92 tok/s (sustained)** | **3.11× throughput scaling** |
| **Speculative Acceptance Yield** | ~60% – 65% | **75.0% – 89.7%** | Fused GDN & 64-bit ancestor SpecTree DAG |

## Modularity & Portability

- **Upstream Cleanliness:** All additions are structured by subsystem; cherry-picking into upstream Strata requires no architectural rewrites.
- **Zero Hardcoded Paths:** All paths and configurations are dynamic and relative; no local lab paths exist in defaults.
- **Graceful Fallbacks:** On single-GPU or non-Ada architectures, features fall back cleanly to standard linear execution paths.
